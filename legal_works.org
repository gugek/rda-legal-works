* Introduction to RDA & Legal Works

** Overview
  - Title of Legal Works
  - Creators of Legal Works
  - Authorized Access Points of Laws
  - Authorized Access Points of Treaties

  #+BEGIN_NOTES
  - In AACR2 we had uniform titles which provided a way in the card
    environment to collocate laws and treaties of a jurisdiction
  - Now we have AAPs which provide identifiers to legal works
  - Our aim here is to create authorized access points for legal materials.

    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    If there is no title or form of title in the original language established
    as the one by which the work is commonly identified or in case of doubt
    then:
      - *choose the title proper of the original edition (see 2.3.2) as the
        preferred title.*
    #+END_QUOTE
*** Caveats

     of the manifestation.

     treaties. This is gone now.

     collective title.

    110 1# Chicago (Ill.). Chicago Zoning Ordinance
    #+END_EXAMPLE

*** Relationship Designator
    + No relationship designator in NARs

    For bibliographic
      + ~$e enacting jurisdiction~ seems to be the default
      + But can always fall back to nothing.
      + "Creator"" relationships versus "associated"

** Other Bodies Associated with a Legal Work

   - Judicial decisions & opinions
*** Court Proceedings
    - Not a creator relationship?
    - Not often we would need a NAR for it

      - reporters
      - related entity: court
