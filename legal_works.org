* Introduction to RDA & Legal Works

** Overview
  - Title of Legal Works
  - Creators of Legal Works
  - Authorized Access Points of Laws
  - Authorized Access Points of Treaties

  #+BEGIN_NOTES
  - In AACR2 we had uniform titles which provided a way in the card
    environment to collocate laws and treaties of a jurisdiction
  - Now we have AAPs which provide identifiers to legal works
  - Our aim here is to create authorized access points for legal materials.

    If there is no title or form of title in the original language established
    as the one by which the work is commonly identified or in case of doubt
    then:
      - *choose the title proper of the original edition (see 2.3.2) as the
        preferred title.*
